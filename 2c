The distance between two points x and y is the square root of the sum 
of squared differences along each dimension of x and y. 
Create a function distance(x, y) that takes two vectors and outputs 
the distance between them. Use your function to find the distance 
between x=(0,0) and y=(1,1).

Print your answer.
