# Create a list of R=10000 booleans called inside that determines whether each point 
# in x falls within the unit circle centered at (0,0). Make sure to use in_circle.

# Find the proportion of points within the circle by summing the count of True in inside, 
# and dividing by R.

# Print your answer. This proportion is an estimate of the ratio of the two areas!


R = 10000
x = []
inside = []
for i in range(R):
    point = [rand(), rand()]
    x.append(point)
    # Enter your code here! #
    inside.append(in_circle(point))
    
# Enter your code here! #
print(inside.count(True))
