# create_board(), random_place(board, player), and evaluate(board) 
# have been created from previous exercises. 
# Create a function play_game() that creates a board, calls alternates 
# between two players (beginning with Player 1), and evaluates the 
# board for a winner after every placement. 
# Play the game until one player wins (returning 1 or 2 to reflect the 
# winning player), or the game is a draw (returning -1).

# Call play_game once.

# write your code here!
