# Use the play_game() function to play 1,000 random games, 
# where Player 1 always goes first.

# When doing this, import and use the time library to call the time 
# function both before and after playing all 1,000 games in order 
# to evaluate how long this takes per game. Print your answer.

# The library matplotlib.pyplot has already been stored as plt. 
# Use plt.hist and plt.show to plot a histogram of the results. 
# Does Player 1 win more than Player 2? Does either player win 
# more than each player draws?

# write your code here!
import time

startTime = time.time()
results = []

for n in range(10):
    results.append(play_game())
endTime = time.time()
    
print(startTime - endTime)

plt.hist(results)
plt.show()
