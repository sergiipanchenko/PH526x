# For our tic-tac-toe board, we will use a numpy array with dimension 3 by 3. 
# Make a function create_board() that creates such a board, with values of integers 0.

# Call create_board(), and store this as board.

# write your code here!
import numpy as np

def create_board():
    board = np.zeros((3,3), dtype=int)
    return board

board = create_board()
