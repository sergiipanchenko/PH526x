# Players 1 and 2 will take turns changing values of this array from a 0 to a 1 or 2, 
# indicating the number of the player who places there. 
# Create a function place(board, player, position) with player being the current player 
# (an integer 1 or 2), and position a tuple of length 2 specifying a desired location 
# to place their marker. 
# Only allow the current player to place a piece on the board 
# (change the board position to their number) if that position is empty (zero).

# Use create_board() to store a board as board, and use place to have 
# Player 1 place a piece on spot (0, 0).

# write your code here!
def place(board, player, position):
    board[position] = player

board = create_board()
player = 1
spot = (0, 0)

place(board, player, spot)
