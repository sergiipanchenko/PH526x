# or the current player at random among all the available positions 
# (those currently set to 0).

# Find possible placements with possibilities(board).

# Select one possible placement at random using random.choice(selection).

# board is already defined from previous exercises. 
# Call random_place(board, player) to place a random marker for Player 2, 
# and store this as board to update its value.

# write your code here!
def random_place(board, player):
    spot = random.choice(possibilities(board))
