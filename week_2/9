# Create a function evaluate(board) that uses row_win, col_win, 
# and diag_win functions for both players. 
# If one of them has won, return that player's number. 
# If the board is full but no one has won, return -1. Otherwise, return 0.

# board is already defined from previous exercises. 
# Call evaluate to see if either player has won the game yet.

def evaluate(board):
    winner = 0
    for player in [1, 2]:
        # Check if `row_win`, `col_win`, or `diag_win` apply.  if so, store `player` as `winner`.
        if row_win(board, player) or col_win(board, player) or diag_win(board, player):
            return player
    if np.all(board != 0) and winner == 0:
        winner = -1
    return winner

# add your code here.
evaluate(board)
