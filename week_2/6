# Now that players may place their pieces, how will they know they've won? 
# Make a function row_win(board, player) that takes the player (integer), 
# and determines if any row consists of only their marker. 
# Have it return True of this condition is met, and False otherwise.

# board is already defined from previous exercises. 
# Call row_win to check if Player 1 has a complete row.

# write your code here!
def row_win(board, player):
    for i in range(3):
#        if np.all(board[i] == player):
        if np.all(board[i] == player, axis = 0):
            return True
    return False

player = 1
row_win(board, player)
