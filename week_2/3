# Create a function possibilities(board) that returns a list of all 
# positions (tuples) on the board that are not occupied (0). 
# (Hint: numpy.where is a handy function that returns a list of 
# indexes that meet a condition.)

# board is already defined from previous exercises. 
# Call possibilities(board) to see what it returns!

# write your code here!

def possibilities(board):
    return np.where(board == 0)

possibilities(board)
