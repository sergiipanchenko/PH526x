"""
distance(x, y) is pre-loaded from part 2c. 
Write a function in_circle(x, origin) that determines whether 
a two-dimensional point falls within a unit circle surrounding a given origin. 
Your function should return a boolean that is True if the 
distance between x and origin is less than 1, and False otherwise.

Use your function to determine whether the point (1,1) lies within 
the unit circle centered at (0,0).

Print your answer.
