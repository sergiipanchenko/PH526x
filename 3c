# moving_window_average(x, n_neighbors=2) and Y are already loaded into memory. 
# For each list in Y, calculate and store the range (the maximum minus the minimum) in a new list ranges.

# Print your answer. As the window width increases, does the range of each list increase or decrease? 
# Why do you think that is?
